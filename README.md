If I’m not working on my own projects or projects for others, I’m studying new skills to keep from falling behind the technological curve. If you have a web project or job opening for which you are in need of a reliable, perfectionist engineer who loves to code, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me in my contact me section on my portfolio page.
