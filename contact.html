    <p>My name is Aaron Jacob Smith. I was born in Conroe Texas in 1986 and my family lived in the Woodlands right outside of Houston Texas. When I was around two my family and I moved to Rockwall Texas just north of Dallas and we lived there for around two years before moving to Jackson Mississippi where I grew up till I went to college.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I attended the University Of Mississippi in Oxford Mississippi. I got a Bachelor of Arts degree from there majoring in Psychology and a minoring in english. During my time in Oxford I worked as a chef at a cajun steak house working my way through the different positions in the kitchen till I became sous chef.</p>
    <br>
    <p>During my junior year of college I met my now wife, Maebh, and after we were both done with school I decided that I would move to Dallas where she was from. Shortly after moving to Dallas I got my first job as a sales rep for a liquor distributor, Republic National Distributing Company, and was resposible for selling wine to grocery stores. I worked for RNDC for a total of almost four years before I decided I would like to move to the other side of the company and start selling wine to restaurants, bars, hotels, etc. My company was reluctant to move me out of the retail world which i found out after they just didn't want to lose me on that side of the buisness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I reached out to some of the people that I knew from my competing company, Southern Glazers Wine & Spirits, that my wife worked at for two years and they ended up having one of the top sales routes in Dallas open up and they called me in for a interview. I ended up getting the job and have now been working in that role for almost three years now.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have now come to realize that I don't want to be in sales for my career so I started looking at different options and things that I may like doing. I knew since my entire career was in sales that I may have to do some sort of continuing education so that I could move into a different career. I just so happened to have a friend that went through the SMU Coding Bootcamp and after talking to him thought that I may like to pursue web development. I ended up doing some free courses online and really enjoyed them so I decided to sign up and go through the course myself.</p>
